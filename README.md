## ðŸ“Œ Description

Python wrapper around C++ helper to compute the following local geometric features in parallel on CPU:
- linearity
- planarity
- scattering
- verticality
- normal_x
- normal_y
- normal_z
- length
- surface
- volume
- curvature
- optimal neighborhood size


## ðŸ§± Installation

Tested

```bash
# clone project
https://github.com/drprojects/point_geometric_features.git
cd point_geometric_features

# Installation in a dedicated conda environment
bash install.sh
```

## ðŸš€ Using `pgeof`

The `pgeof` function of the `pgeof` module should be used as follows:

```python
import sys
import os.path as osp
sys.path.append(osp.join(osp.realpath(osp.dirname(__file__)), "python/bin"))
from pgeof import pgeof

pgeof(
    xyz,              # ndarray - Array of size (n_points, 3) holding the XYZ coordinates for N points
    nn,               # ndarray - Array of size (n_neighbors) holding the points' neighbor indices flattened for CSR format
    nn_ptr,           # ndarray - Array of size (n_points + 1) indicating the start and end indices of each point's neighbors in nn
    k_min=1,          # int - Minimum number of neighbors to consider for features computation. If less, the point set will be given 0 features
    k_step=-1,        # int - Step size to take when searching for the optimal neighborhood size, following: http://lareg.ensg.eu/labos/matis/pdf/articles_revues/2015/isprs_wjhm_15.pdf. If k_step < 1, the optimal neighborhood will be computed based on all the neighbors available for each point 
    k_min_search=10,  # int - Minimum neighborhood size used when searching the optimal neighborhood size. It is advised to use a value of 10 or higher
    verbose=False)    # bool - Whether computation progress should be printed out
```

## ðŸ’³ Credits
This implementation was largely inspired from [Superpoint Graph](https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph). The main modifications here allow: 
- parallel computation on all points' local neighborhoods, with neighborhoods of varying sizes
- more geometric features
- some corrections on geometric features computation
