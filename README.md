## üìå Description

Python wrapper around C++ helper to compute, for each point in a 3D point cloud, local geometric features in parallel on CPU:

<details>
<summary><b>Ô∏èList of computed featuresÔ∏è</b></summary>

- linearity
- planarity
- scattering
- verticality
- normal_x
- normal_y
- normal_z
- length
- surface
- volume
- curvature
- optimal neighborhood size

</details>


## üß± Installation

The following will install the project in a new `pgeof` conda environment.

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/drprojects/point_geometric_features.git
cd point_geometric_features

# Installation in a new dedicated `pgeof` conda environment
bash install.sh
```

You can easily adapt `install.sh` to install the project in an already-existing 
environment.


## üöÄ Using Point Geometric Features

The `pgeof` function of the `pgeof` module should be used as follows:

```python
import sys
import os.path as osp
sys.path.append(osp.join(osp.realpath(osp.dirname(__file__)), "python/bin"))
from pgeof import pgeof

pgeof(
    xyz,              # ndarray - Array of size (n_points, 3) holding the XYZ coordinates for N points
    nn,               # ndarray - Array of size (n_neighbors) holding the points' neighbor indices flattened for CSR format
    nn_ptr,           # ndarray - Array of size (n_points + 1) indicating the start and end indices of each point's neighbors in nn
    k_min=1,          # int - Minimum number of neighbors to consider for features computation. If less, the point set will be given 0 features
    k_step=-1,        # int - Step size to take when searching for the optimal neighborhood size, following: http://lareg.ensg.eu/labos/matis/pdf/articles_revues/2015/isprs_wjhm_15.pdf. If k_step < 1, the optimal neighborhood will be computed based on all the neighbors available for each point 
    k_min_search=10,  # int - Minimum neighborhood size used when searching the optimal neighborhood size. It is advised to use a value of 10 or higher
    verbose=False)    # bool - Whether computation progress should be printed out
```

You may check out the provided demonstration script to get started üëá

```bash
python demo.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note the **neighbors are expected in CSR format**. This allows 
expressing neighborhoods of varying sizes with dense arrays (eg the output of a 
radius search).


## üí≥ Credits
This implementation was largely inspired from [Superpoint Graph](https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph). The main modifications here allow: 
- parallel computation on all points' local neighborhoods, with neighborhoods of varying sizes
- more geometric features
- optimal neighborhood search from this [paper](http://lareg.ensg.eu/labos/matis/pdf/articles_revues/2015/isprs_wjhm_15.pdf)
- some corrections on geometric features computation
