## ðŸ“Œ Description

Python wrapper around C++ helper to compute the following local geometric features in parallel on CPU:
- linearity
- planarity
- scattering
- verticality
- normal_x
- normal_y
- normal_z
- length
- surface
- volume
- curvature


## ðŸ§± Installation

```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/YourGithubName/your-repo-name
cd your-repo-name

# Installation in a dedicated conda environment
.install.sh
```

## ðŸš€ Demo

```bash
python demo.py
```


## Credits :credit_card:
This implementation was largely inspired from [Superpoint Graph](https://github.com/loicland/superpoint_graph). The modifications here allow: 
- parallel computation on all points' local neighborhoods, with neighborhoods of varying sizes
- more geometric features
- some corrections on geometric features computation
